# credit_card_fraud_detection
This project aims to analyse the famous credit card fraud detection data set and build predictive classification models and compare the different metrics

# Checkpoint achieved - 03rd August 2021
- Loading the dataset
- Identifying the data dimensions
- Analysing the datatypes of each column
- Plotting the box-plots for each column
- Determining the class imbalance in the target variable

# Checkpoint achieved - 17th August 2021
- Applying PCA
- Plotting the scree plot
- Determining that PCA is not a correct choice
- Exploring feature selection techniques
- Applying suggested feature selection technique 
- Determining scores corresponding to each feature and finding the top 10 relevant features

# Checkpoint achieved - 20th August 2021
- Applying stratification to create train-test split
- Verified the class imbalance proportion in train-test data 
- Fit a DecisionTree classifier and find F1 score
- Apply ccp_alpha pruning on the classifier and find F1 score
- Apply RandomForest classifier and find F1 score
- Set the baseline F1 score for reference
